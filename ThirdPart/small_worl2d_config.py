## Time Scale

# The update time should be "negligible" wrt. the faster cycle times.
# High-level Soul's should typically update about once per second,
# while Low-level Soul's would update about 10 times faster --- if not asap (T=0).
# Therefore, 0.1 s real-time must take some more time than the typical update,
# which can be measured. For my set-up, the update of a few tens of Soul's
# takes a fraction of a second, hence the simulation of 0.1 s shoud take about 1 s, so:
TS=5 # simulation-time seconds per real-time second

# For a movie with 10 fps, each redraw at "real-time" would happen each 0.1 s
# so, with TS=1, the redraw time should be RT=0.1:
RT=0.1*TS # simulation-time seconds per frame, for a 10 fps movie

# Normal max vels, in units per sec
# In accordance with the above on time scale, vels in units per second should be scaled
# The normal velocity must be a small displacement (wrt. the 2Wx2H sized canvas or np.pi) per redraw
# Max vel's should be a fraction of vN and wN
vN=1/TS # traverse 1 unit distance in 1 sec real-time
wN=60*2*pi/(60*TS) # 60 rpm real-time
